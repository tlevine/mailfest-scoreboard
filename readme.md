Mailfest Scoreboard
======

**Mailfest** is a hypothetical email-writing event. People meet with food and
alcohol to write emails that they've been meaning to write in company of other
nice people. The company of others also helps them deal with difficult emails.

* People can work together on the composition of individual emails.
* People might discuss problems with email and create small tools to help with
    email composition.
* People can ask for help on a particular sort of email.

The **Mailfest Scoreboard** keeps track of how much has been accomplished.
Once it has been installed, mailfest participants just need to BCC all emails
that they write during the mailfest to the email address for which the
scoreboard has been configured. The scoreboard will produce statistics about
the emails that have been sent and about the people who have been sending them.

The emails are deleted immediately after they are read, and information about
recipients is deleted, but you should still avoid sending particularly secret
things to the mailfest scoreboard.

## Install
